# my-portfolio

== Introduction ==

Hi, my name is Emma. I'm studying to become a better data analyst and software developer, with one year of data analysis experience. I'm currently looking for employment.

== Skills ==

My programming education was primarily in C++, which is the language in which I learned about data structures, algorithm design, and object-oriented programming. 
Independently, I study Python (including PyData stack libraries like Numpy, pandas, and matplotlib) and web development (primarily front-end - HTML and CSS). 
I'm pretty familiar with Microsoft Excel after using it for data analysis and visualization for my last job.
Overall, I have a broad mathematical background, though I focused on statistics at the end of my Bachelor's.

== Projects ==

For now, this portfolio will mostly include projects from free certifications that I am working to complete. I hope to include more complex personal projects in the
future. In the meantime, please browse my certification projects.
